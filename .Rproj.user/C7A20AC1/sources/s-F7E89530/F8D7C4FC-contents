# Ships
 R/Shiny Developer - Appsilon Test
Goals
●	User can select a vessel type from the dropdown field
●	User can select a vessel name from a dropdown field (available vessels should correspond to selected type). Dropdown fields should be created as a Shiny module
●	For the vessel selected, find the observation when it sailed the longest distance between two consecutive observations (ca. 30 sec). If there is a situation when a vessel moves exactly the same amount of meters at the same time please select the most recent.  
●	Display that on the map - show two points, the beginning and the end of the movement. Map should be created using the leaflet library. Changing type and vessel name should re-render the map and the note.
●	Provide a short note saying how much the ship sailed - distance should be provided in meters.
●	Also please use best practices you know, to ensure project quality. Application should be reasonably efficient and tested with testthat.
●	Please think about the app interface inspired by the following mockups. You can add additional statistics and visualizations to make your dashboard look attractive. It depends on you how you want to structure it.
